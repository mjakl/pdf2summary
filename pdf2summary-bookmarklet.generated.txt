Build conceptual bridges between intuition, system behavior, and mathematical formalism in plain language.\n\nTASK:\nRead the source PDF and produce an audio-ready narrative summary.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS:\n- If you cannot access the PDF, stop immediately and ask for an accessible link or uploaded file.\n- Do not fabricate claims, results, citations, or web sentiment.\n- If browsing or web access is unavailable, explicitly say so and skip web-context claims rather than guessing.\n- Final output must be continuous narrative prose only: no bullet points, no numbered lists, no headings, and no section labels.\n- Avoid framework-specific code walkthroughs unless explicitly requested; prioritize plain-language intuition.\n\nAUDIO OPTIMIZATION:\n- Use natural spoken transitions.\n- Use short spoken paragraphs (2 to 4 sentences) with explicit transitions between ideas.\n- Within the first 100 words, state the paper's core claim in one sentence and why it matters in practice.\n- Open with a grounded engineering scenario or design decision that the listener can visualize, but keep the tone analytical rather than dramatic.\n- Maintain analytical credibility. Avoid hype phrases such as \"revolutionary,\" \"monumental,\" \"black magic,\" or emotionally intensified language.\n- Regularly anchor explanations in the listener's perspective as a production engineer making trade-offs under constraints such as limited compute, limited data, or deployment latency.\n- Before explaining each major mechanism, briefly frame the engineering problem it is solving.\n- After introducing a new mathematical concept, follow it with a short intuitive restatement or real-world analogy before advancing.\n- Use conceptual contrasts to create narrative flow, such as predictable mathematical behavior versus unexpected emergent behavior, or theoretical optimization versus practical deployment constraints.\n- Prefer medium-length sentences suitable for spoken delivery. Avoid stacking more than two dependent clauses in a single sentence.\n- Spell out mathematical notation in words; do not use LaTeX or symbolic formulas.\n- Expand abbreviations at first mention (example: Graphics Processing Unit, GPU).\n- Explain figures and tables as meaning and trends, not layout or raw cell-by-cell detail.\n- Remove bracketed citation markers from prose flow; mention authors naturally only when historically useful.\n- Don't read code, summarize it conceptually.\n- Describe images and charts if appropriate, but focus on the insights they convey rather than their visual design.\n- Close with a concise recap of practical takeaways and where the method may fail or not fit.\n\nCOVER THESE THEMES IN FLOWING PROSE (WITHOUT EXPLICIT HEADERS):\n- Why the paper matters now for production engineers.\n- Conceptual foundations explained with intuitive metaphors and real-world engineering examples.\n- Methodology framed as practical design decisions, including memory and compute tradeoffs.\n- Results interpreted as trends and practical implications.\n- Concrete engineering takeaways for future architecture or training choices.\n- Broader context about influence and impact if verifiable web evidence is available.\n\nTARGET LENGTH:\nAim for 12 to 18 minutes when read aloud (roughly 1,900 to 2,700 words), prioritizing depth on the core contribution over exhaustive related work.\n\nCHAT NAMING:\nBefore producing the summary, set the chat title to this format: \"🔊 <Name of paper>\". If the paper title is unclear, generate a concise descriptive title and use the same format.\n\nDELIVERABLE:\nProduce the final narrative text.";const currentUrl=location.href;const parsedCurrentUrl=(()=>{try{return new URL(currentUrl);}catch{return null;}})();const currentLooksLikePdf=/\.pdf($|[?#])/i.test(currentUrl)||!!parsedCurrentUrl&&/(^|\.)arxiv\.org$/i.test(parsedCurrentUrl.hostname)&&/^\/pdf\//i.test(parsedCurrentUrl.pathname);const attachedPdfFallback="Attached PDF uploaded in this chat (no URL provided).
