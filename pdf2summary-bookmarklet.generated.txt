Build conceptual bridges between intuition, system behavior, and mathematical formalism in plain language.\n\nTASK:\n\nRead the source PDF and produce an audio-ready narrative summary.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS:\n\nIf you cannot access the PDF, stop immediately and ask for an accessible link or uploaded file.\n\nDo not fabricate claims, results, citations, or web sentiment.\n\nIf browsing or web access is unavailable, explicitly say so and skip web-context claims rather than guessing.\n\nFinal output must be continuous narrative prose only: no bullet points, no numbered lists, no headings, and no section labels.\n\nAvoid framework-specific code walkthroughs unless explicitly requested; prioritize plain-language intuition.\n\nAUDIO OPTIMIZATION:\n\nUse natural spoken transitions.\n\nUse short spoken paragraphs (2 to 4 sentences) with explicit transitions between ideas.\n\nWithin the first 100 words, state the paper's core claim in one sentence and why it matters in practice.\n\nOpen with a grounded engineering scenario or design decision that the listener can visualize, but keep the tone analytical rather than dramatic.\n\nMaintain analytical credibility. Avoid hype phrases such as “revolutionary,” “monumental,” “black magic,” or emotionally intensified language.\n\nRegularly anchor explanations in the listener’s perspective as a production engineer making trade-offs under constraints such as limited compute, limited data, or deployment latency.\n\nBefore explaining each major mechanism, briefly frame the engineering problem it is solving.\n\nAfter introducing a new mathematical concept, follow it with a short intuitive restatement or real-world analogy before advancing.\n\nUse conceptual contrasts to create narrative flow, such as predictable mathematical behavior versus unexpected emergent behavior, or theoretical optimization versus practical deployment constraints.\n\nPrefer medium-length sentences suitable for spoken delivery. Avoid stacking more than two dependent clauses in a single sentence.\n\nSpell out mathematical notation in words; do not use LaTeX or symbolic formulas.\n\nExpand abbreviations at first mention (example: Graphics Processing Unit, GPU).\n\nExplain figures and tables as meaning and trends, not layout or raw cell-by-cell detail.\n\nRemove bracketed citation markers from prose flow; mention authors naturally only when historically useful.\n\nDon’t read code, summarize it conceptually.\n\nDescribe images and charts if appropriate, but focus on the insights they convey rather than their visual design.\n\nClose with a concise recap of practical takeaways and where the method may fail or not fit.\n\nCOVER THESE THEMES IN FLOWING PROSE (WITHOUT EXPLICIT HEADERS):\n\nWhy the paper matters now for production engineers; conceptual foundations explained with intuitive metaphors and real-world engineering examples; methodology framed as practical design decisions including memory and compute tradeoffs; results interpreted as trends and practical implications; concrete engineering takeaways for future architecture or training choices; broader context about influence and impact if verifiable web evidence is available.\n\nTARGET LENGTH:\n\nAim for 12 to 18 minutes when read aloud (roughly 1,900 to 2,700 words), prioritizing depth on the core contribution over exhaustive related work.\n\nCHAT NAMING:\n\nBefore producing the summary, set the chat title to this format: \"🔊 <Name of paper>\". If the paper title is unclear, generate a concise descriptive title and use the same format.\n\nDELIVERABLE:\n\nProduce the final narrative text.";const currentUrl=location.href;const parsedCurrentUrl=(()=>{try{return new URL(currentUrl);}catch{return null;}})();const currentLooksLikePdf=/\.pdf($|[?#])/i.test(currentUrl)||!!parsedCurrentUrl&&/(^|\.)arxiv\.org$/i.test(parsedCurrentUrl.hostname)&&/^\/pdf\//i.test(parsedCurrentUrl.pathname);const attachedPdfFallback="Attached PDF uploaded in this chat (no URL provided).
